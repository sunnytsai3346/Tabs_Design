# Tabs_Design
Create Tabs 
 - Build a tabs component that displays one panel of content at a time depending on the active tab element. Some HTML is provided for you as example contents.

 - Requirements
Clicking on a tab makes it the active tab. Add a visual indication (e.g. using blue text color) for the active tab to differentiate it from the non-active tabs.
At all times, only one panel's contents should be displayed â€” the one corresponding to the active tab's.
